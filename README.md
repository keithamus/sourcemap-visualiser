# sourcemap-visualiser

This is yet-another-visualiser for build tools, like Disc or Webpack thingy or
blah. In true [XCKD](https://xkcd.com/927/) tradition though, this one is
different! It aims to be a universal visualiser - instead of plugging into a
build chain, it uses sourcemaps to gather all the info it needs! This means it
works with any build tool that outputs a SourceMap file!


Docs are in progress. Come back later to see more.
